A set of funny arithmetic mini-games (command line):
* __balanced numbers__  
balanced is a number where smallest digit differs from the biggest one not more than by 1.  
Example: 123 is not balanced because the difference between 3 and 1 is 2, > 1. The balanced number of 123 is 222.  
Calculate the sum of all digits of a given number. Then find a number with the same sum, but composed of one or at most two digits with difference 1. The order of digits must be ascending.

* __calculator__  
The game shows random arithmetic expression. Provide the correct answer/

* __even__  
If the number is even or odd.

* __gcd__
  greatest common divisor of two numbers

* __progression__  
  find a number missed in the progression

* __prime__
